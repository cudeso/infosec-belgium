## Message retention

We're using the default message retention option provided by slack, reproduced below. This is the only option currently available on the free plan.

    Retain all messages
    This is the default setting. Slack will retain all of your team's messages, but will not keep logs of user's message edits and deletions, found in a team's data export.
